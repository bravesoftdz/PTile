# PTile

A tiling "window manager" for Windows.

## TODO

### General

* Replace the Windows shell.
* See [this README.md](https://github.com/R030t1/Tile/blob/master/README.md).

### SetWinEventHook

* Why do some windows not count as new objects?
* The string "XCP" appeared as a window title after right-clicking on Firefox in
the start menu to open a new window.
